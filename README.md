# Caesar-Cipher

A small program written for fun and for the purposes of learning the Tkinter library.

## Current status: Stable and functioning, but some bugs may still be present.

## How to use this program
Currently, the program is only available in the form of a Python script, `caesar-cipher.py`. Running this script on any system with Python installed will launch the program.

### Requirements
- A Python installation
- Tkinter 8.5/8.6 (most Python installations should include this; run `python -m tkinter` in your terminal of choice to display a window listing your installed version). This program was written with Tkinter 8.6; some features might not work with older Tkinter versions.

### Instructions
To use this program, enter the text that you wish to shift in the left-hand text box, select the shift value from the dropdown menu, and click the "Go" button. The shifted text will appear in the right-hand text box.

### Limitations
Only ASCII characters are supported.
